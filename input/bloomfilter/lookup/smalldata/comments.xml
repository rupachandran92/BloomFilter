That would be one solution. Another would be to simply let clicks pass to whatever control they are over, whether it is in the currently active window or not. Is that doable?"

<row Id="7" PostId="7" Score="0" Text="Honestly, I don't know. It's definitely interesting though. I'm currently scouring Google, since it would save on input clicks. I'm just concerned that any solution might get a little "hack-y" and not behave consistently in all UI elements or applications.
